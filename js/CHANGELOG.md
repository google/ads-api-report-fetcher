# Changelog
## 2.12.2 - 2024-10-29
* resource index customizer ("~0") support not only string fields but also structs with predefined fields (name/text/assset/value),
  automatically extract their values

## 2.12.1 - 2024-10-04
* added filtering ouf of hidden accounts while expanding MCC

## 2.12 - 2024-09-13
* support Google Ads API v17.1 (updated google-ads-api to v17.1)

## 2.11.1 - 2024-08-14
* Fix: `FileWriterBase`: disabled resumable upload for streaming to GCS, increased maxRetries - to overcome sporadic failures of GCS API on high load

## 2.11 - 2024-08-12
* `BigQueryWriter` and all file-based writers (`CsvWriter`/`JsonWriter`) support `outputPath` option with paths on GCS. Via cli it's passed as `--bq.output-path`, `--csv.output-path`, `--json.output-path`.
* All writers implemented streaming to files (including paths on GCS). It's especially useful in Gaarf-WF where gaarf Cloud Function streams data to files on GCS.
* added REST API support (along with existing gRPC). Now there're two clients: `GoogleAdsRpcClient` (renamed existing GoogleAdsClient) and `GoogleAdsRestClient` (new one). A client is chosen via `--api` option: `--api=rest` (REST) or `--api=rpc` (gRCP) - default. For the REST client a API verson can be provided via `--api-version`.
* `AdsQueryExecutor`: introduced a new method executeQueryAndParseToObjects to returns values as objects, using a new mode for `AdsRowParser.parseRow`.
* diag: support DUMP_MEMORY envvar to output current memory usage to log

## 2.10 - 2024-05-09
* added a new writer - JsonWirter (`--output=json`)
* added `account-tree` cli command to show account info with subaccounts (`gaarf account-tree <options>`)

## 2.9 - 2024-03-04
* support Google Ads API v16 (updated google-ads-api to v16)

## 2.8 - 2023-11-29
* files with glob wildcards are now supported (`*` and `**`), so gaarf can process files by mask without relying on shell's wildcard expansion
* Fix: console-writer: fixed hanging in some cases, prettified output for arrays
* Fix: cli: aliases for `loglevel` argument weren't handled correctly for initializing logger
* ads-api-client: added additional error codes from grpc to handle for retrying (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED)
* console-writer: by default it limits output to 1000 rows

## 2.7 - 2023-11-06
* added 'validate' cli command for validating ads credentials: `gaarf validate --ads-config=/path/to/google-ads.yaml`
* added silent mode: `--loglevel=off`

## 2.6 - 2023-11-03
* support for `--input=console` cli argument allows to supply queries in command file, e.g. `gaarf "select campaign.id from campaign" --input=console`

## 2.5 - 2023-10-04
* support for builtin resources
* support for the `*` selector in Ads queries - it expands to all scalar primitive and enum fields of a resource
* bq-writer: Fixed: writer failed with 'dataset not found' error if dataset exists in a different location than specified
* console-writer: Fixed: writer went to the infinite recursion if the only one column didn't fit into console width after transposing

## 2.4 - 2023-09-22
* support Google Ads API v14.1 (updated google-ads-api to v14.1)
 
## 2.3 - 2023-09-07

## 2.1 - 2023-07-26
* Fix: [bq-writer] integer fields got string type if bq.array-handling=strings was specified

## 2.0 - 2023-07-11
* breaking: gaarf CLI tool supports multiple CIDs in `account` argument. 
`GoogleAdsApiClient` constructor and `loadAdsConfigFromFile` don't take customer_id anymore, 
but `GoogleAdsApiClient`'s methods `getCustomerIds`, `executeQuery` and `executeQueryStream` on the contrary now require a customer_id.
* Templates support (via https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
* AdsQueryExecutor: limit level of parallelism (be default there's a threshold to issue simultaneous parallel queries)
* CsvWriter: support `file-per-customer` argument - split output file by customer

* csv-writer: added `array-separator` option + similar object to bq-writer for array representation (previously JSON.stringify used)

## 1.12 - 2023-03-31
* Added `disable-account-expansion` flag to disable MCC account expansion into child accounts (useful when you need to execute a query at MCC level)
* (released as 1.11.9) enhanced logging support for running in Google Cloud (while running as part Gaarf Workflow all log entries have trace id from the root request)

* ConsoleWriter: added `page-size` argument (limits maximum row count per script)
* ConsoleWriter: added `destination` alias for `destination-folder` argument

## 1.10 - 2022-12-14

## 1.7.0 - 2022-09-09

* ConsoleWriter (`--output=console`) - output query results to stdout, supports transposing (if a table doesn't fit in terminal window it's transposed and splitted onto several horizontal tables) which can be tuned via cli args
* all console output replaced with logging, setting log-level via cli args

## 1.4.0 - 2022-07-22
