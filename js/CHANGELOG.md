# Changelog
## 2.7 - 2023-1106
* added 'validate' cli command for validating ads credentials: `gaarf validate --ads-config=/path/to/google-ads.yaml`
* added silent mode: `--loglevel=off`

## 2.6 - 2023-11-03
* support for `--input=console` cli argument allows to supply queries in command file, e.g. `gaarf "select campaign.id from campaign" --input=console`

## 2.5 - 2023-10-04
* support for builtin resources
* support for the `*` selector in Ads queries - it expands to all scalar primitive and enum fields of a resource
* bq-writer: Fixed: writer failed with 'dataset not found' error if dataset exists in a different location than specified
* console-writer: Fixed: writer went to the infinite recursion if the only one column didn't fit into console width after transposing

## 2.4 - 2023-09-22
* support Google Ads API v14.1 (updated google-ads-api to v14.1)
 
## 2.3 - 2023-09-07
* Improved error handling and logging of errors, added retrying on internal errors from the API (for sync and async methods both)

## 2.2 - 2023-07-27
* added `current_date`, `current_datetime` macros additionally to `date_iso` for Python-version compatibility

* Fix: [bq-writer] integer fields got string type if bq.array-handling=strings was specified

## 2.0 - 2023-07-11
* breaking: gaarf CLI tool supports multiple CIDs in `account` argument. 
`GoogleAdsApiClient` constructor and `loadAdsConfigFromFile` don't take customer_id anymore, 
but `GoogleAdsApiClient`'s methods `getCustomerIds`, `executeQuery` and `executeQueryStream` on the contrary now require a customer_id.
* Templates support (via https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
* AdsQueryExecutor: limit level of parallelism (be default there's a threshold to issue simultaneous parallel queries)

## 1.15 - 2023-05-18
* added support for `date_iso` macro (to be compatible with the Python version)
* added global executable aliases `gaarf-node` and `gaarf-node-bq`

* csv-writer: added `array-separator` option + similar object to bq-writer for array representation (previously JSON.stringify used)

## 1.12 - 2023-03-31
* Added `disable-account-expansion` flag to disable MCC account expansion into child accounts (useful when you need to execute a query at MCC level)
* (released as 1.11.9) enhanced logging support for running in Google Cloud (while running as part Gaarf Workflow all log entries have trace id from the root request)

## 1.11 - 2023-02-11

## 1.7.2 - 2022-09-13
* support Google Ads API v11.1 (updated google-ads-api to v11)

## 1.7.1 - 2022-09-09
* Fix: fixed running in Cloud Function environment

## 1.7.0 - 2022-09-09
* BigQueryWrite: changed data load method (loadTable instead of insertAll), which results in a significant speed up

## 1.4.1 - 2022-07-27
* ConsoleWriter (`--output=console`) - output query results to stdout, supports transposing (if a table doesn't fit in terminal window it's transposed and splitted onto several horizontal tables) which can be tuned via cli args
* all console output replaced with logging, setting log-level via cli args

## 1.4.0 - 2022-07-22
* support expressions (`${...}`) (based on [mathjs](https://mathjs.org) library) in queries (both Ads and BigQuery)
* breaking: removed `date_iso` built-in macro (easily can be replaced by `${today()}`)
