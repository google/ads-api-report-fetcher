## Intro
Google Ads API Report Fetcher uses [GAQL](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/overview)
syntax with some extended capabilities.


This is how a generic query might look like:

```
SELECT
    ad_group.id,
    ad_group.name
FROM ad_group
```

When running this query and saving the results we get pretty long and unreadable
column names - `ad_group.id` and `ad_group.name`.

Things might be more complicated if you want to extract and save such objects
as unselectable elements, complex messages and resource names.

In order to simplify data extraction and processing when querying data from Ads API
we introduce additional syntax (see an example below):

```
SELECT
    resource.attribute AS column_name_1,
    resource.attribute:nested.resource AS column_name_3
    resource.attribute~1 AS column_name_4
FROM resource
```

## Elements

* Aliases (`AS column_name`)
* Nested resources (`:nested.resource.name`)
* Resource indices (`~position`)
* Functions (`:$func`) - only in Node.js
* Virtual columns (`metric.name / metric.name_2 AS alias`)

### Aliases

Alias is used to give a descriptive name to a metric or attribute fetched from
API when saving data. So instead of column name
`campaign.app_campaign_setting.bidding_strategy_goal_type` you may use something
more user friendly, like `bidding_type`.

Aliases are specified using `AS` keyword as shown below:

```
SELECT
    campaign.app_campaign_setting.bidding_strategy_goal_type AS bidding_type
FROM campaign
```

If you don't specifed an alias it will be generated as full column name where "." replaced with "_".

In NodeJS version autogenerated aliases won't contains current resource name (for example while selecting "campaign.app_campaign_setting.bidding_strategy_goal_type" from campaign there will be a column "app_campaign_setting_bidding_strategy_goal_type")


### Nested Resources

Some fields return structs, and if you want to get a nested attribute scalar value you can use nested resource selectors.  
One particular example is working with `change_event` - `change_event.new_resource`
consists of various changes made to an entity and looks something like that:

```
new_resource {
    campaign {
        target_cpa {
            target_cpa_micros: 1000000
        }
    }
}
```

In order to extract a particular element (i.e., final value for `target_cpa_micros`)
we use the `:` syntax - `change_event.new_resource:campaign.target_cpa.target_cpas_micros`:

```
SELECT
    change_event.old_resource:campaign.target_cpa.target_cpa_micros AS old_target_cpa,
    change_event.new_resource:campaign.target_cpa.target_cpa_micros AS new_target_cpa
FROM change_event
```

### Resource Indices

Resource indices are used to extract a particular element from data type
*RESOURCE_NAME*. I.e., if we want to get resource name for `campaign_audience_view.resource_name`
and save it somewhere, the saved result will contain a string *customers/{customer_id}/campaignAudienceViews/{campaign_id}~{criterion_id}*.
Usually we want to get only the last element from (`criterion_id`) and
it can be extracted with `~N` syntax  where *N* is a position of an element you want to extract
(indexing is starting from 0).

If the resource you're selecting looks like this `customers/111/campaignAudienceViews/222~333`
you can specify `campaign_audience_view.resource_name~1` to extract the second element (`333`).
If you specify `campaign_audience_view.resource_name~0` you'll get '222' (the last resource id before ~).

```
SELECT
    campaign_audience_view.resource_name~1 AS criterion_id
FROM campaign_audience_view
```

### Virtual Columns

Virtual columns allow to specify in GAQL query some fields or expressions that are not present in Google Ads API.

```
SELECT
    1 AS counter,
    metrics.clicks / metrics.impressions AS ctr,
    metrics.cost_micros * 1e6 AS cost,
    campaign.app_campaign_setting.bidding_strategy_goal_type AS bidding_type
FROM campaign
```

Virtual columns can contain constants (i.e. `1 AS counter` will add new column `counter` filled with `1`) or expressions.
Expressions can contain field selectors, constants and any arithmetics operations with them.
For example `metrics.clicks / metrics.impressions AS ctr` will calculate `metrics.clicks / metrics.impressions` for each GoogleAdsRow and store the results in a new column `ctr`. 
For this the fields `metrics.clicks` and `metrics.impressions` will be fetched implicitly.  
Or for example `campaign.target_cpa.target_cpa_micros / 1000000 AS target_cpa` expression will fetche `campaign.target_cpa.target_cpa_micros` field but return the result of its division by 1000000.

The query parser parses a query and remove all columns which are not simple field accessors (i.e. contains anything except field names). 
For constants columns they will be re-added into result after executing the query. For more complex columns with expressions (i.e. some operations with fields) the result will evaluated using the response from Ads API (GoogleAdsRow).


NodeJS versions:  
For constants you can also use same syntax as for macros - `${..}`. For example, a query `SELECT '${today()}' as date` returns a column 'date' with values like '2023-02-11'.
For virtual columns expressions you can use same syntax as inside `${}` with all operators from [MathJS](https://mathjs.org) library but operating any of fields available for a current resource.

There can be a confision between two types of expressions - in `${}` blocks and virtual columns.
First of all virtual columns are supported by both versions (Python/NodeJS) while `${}`-expressions are supported by NodeJS only.
Expressions in `${}` blocks are parsed in the very beginning of query parsing, before submitting a query to Ads API. They are more like templates.
